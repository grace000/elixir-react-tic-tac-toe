# TicTacToe with Elixir and React

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/grace000/elixir-react-tic-tac-toe.svg?branch=master](https://travis-ci.org/grace000/elixir-react-tic-tac-toe)

A classic tic tac toe game involves two players and a board with nine spaces. Each player will take turns filling a space with their token. At the start of the game, each player selects a token of their choice which will represent their selected board spaces. In order to win a game, a player has to gain three board spaces in a row. The row can be horizonal, vertical, or diagonal. If the board fills up before a player gains three spaces, the game will result in a draw. 

## Software and Installation 

To get started, you'll need the following software on your machine. Follow the links for installation instructions. 

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
- [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)

Also check out my [blog](https://tiffanielmore.netlify.com/blog/up-and-running-with-elixir-phoenix-and-react) for starting and deploying an Elixir, Phoenix, React app.

## Usage

After installing the software and cloning the repo, you're ready to play the game.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

You'll see a welcome page prompting you to select a game version.

## Running the tests

Take a look in the test folder for the Elixir tests. Feel free to add tests and run them from the root directory using the following in the terminal:

```
mix test
```
